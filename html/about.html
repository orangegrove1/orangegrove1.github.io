      <p>
        Orange Grove Entertainment is a production group founded on June 20,
        2022. Our first project was to organize a charity event in Don Bosco Catholic School which went successful as we collected over 5 thousand birr in ticket sales. We had left a legacy for the coming batches to do simmilar activities and we feel very proud of it. <br>
        The person who came up with the name was Sami. He is a fan of the game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas - and wanted to pay homage to the fictional Grove Street - so he came up with the name "Orange Grove." <br> <br>

        We're currently high school students learning in Don Bosco High School. We hope we'll do something significant in our time being. <br>
        Thanks for visiting this site.
